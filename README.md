This modpack consists of a set of UI imporovements for Melvor Idle, facilitating the combat experience for the players. For players familiar with crunching numbers, this just feels like a more accessible way to see realtime values of what you'd otherwise see on a spreadsheet.

## Install

Melvor Idle has a way to install mods automatically through the Melvor Mod Manager. The game should be found there.

To make an update, simply make a zip of all the files you want, including the manifest.json. More information is found at the [wiki page](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/w/Mod_Creation).
